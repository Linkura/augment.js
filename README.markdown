# Augment.js

Augment.js is a library that brings JavaScript 1.8.5 to any browser.  It does this by augmenting built in types like `Array` and `Object`, deal with it.  It combines the snippets for implementing native methods, such as `forEach` in JavaScript.

It will only add methods that are not already existing, and augment.js always falls back to native implementations where possible.

## Usage

Augment.js can be used in two ways:

* Auto - All missing 1.8.5 methods are added by augment.js

## API

When using the Auto version of augment.js you only need to include the script to take advantage of the latest JavaScript features.
